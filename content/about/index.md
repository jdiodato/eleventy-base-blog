# 🎶 Music

Since I was 10 years old, picking up a violin for the first time in my elementary school's orchestra proram, music has played an essential role in my life. From orchestra, I went on to play low brass and percussion instruments in various school concert, jazz, and marching bands. While I no longer play the violin or brass instruments, these experiences instilled in me a profound appreciation and joy that comes from making music. <br>

These days, I dabble in a few different areas, learning what I can as my free time allows. My current musical rotation includes: the [Great Highland bagpipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Highland_bagpipe), [uilleann pipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uilleann_pipes), [tin whistle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_whistle), [recorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorder_(musical_instrument)), and I very occasionally dabble in electric bass. 

I occasionally write about my musical journey under the music tag. Interested readers can also find my digital practice log [here](example.com) (link forthcoming)
